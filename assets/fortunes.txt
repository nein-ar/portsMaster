The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren’t there.
!---
One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.
!---
When in doubt, use brute force.
!---
Deleted code is debugged code.
!---
Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.
!---
UNIX was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things.
!---
If you’re willing to restrict flexibility, you can almost always do something better.
!---
A data structure is just a stupid programming language.
!---
A program that produces incorrect results twice as fast is infinitely slower.
!---
Life is too short to run proprietary software.
!---
Ethernet always wins.
!---
The central enemy of reliability is complexity.
!---
Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
!---
Beware of “the real world”.
!---
A program is portable to the extent that it can be moved without rewriting it.
!---
If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter how fast it doesn’t work.
!---
Unix is simple. It just takes a genius to understand its simplicity.
!---
The key to performance is elegance, not special cases.
!---
Measuring progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft by weight.
!---
First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
!---
Correctness is clearly the prime quality.
!---
A language that doesn’t have everything is actually easier to program in.
!---
You can’t trust code you did not totally create yourself.
!---
Object-oriented design is the roman numerals of computing.
!---
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
!---
Compatibility means deliberately repeating other people’s mistakes.
!---
The best code is no code at all.
!---
Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.
!---
More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency.
!---
Program testing can show the presence of bugs, not their absence.
!---
Code never lies, comments sometimes do.
!---
What I cannot build, I do not understand.
!---
The whole point of getting things done is knowing what to leave undone.
!---
When in doubt, leave it out.
!---
No code is faster than no code.
!---
As a rule, software does not work well until it has failed repeatedly.
!---
IDE features are language smells.
!---
A good way to have good ideas is by being unoriginal.
!---
Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.
!---
The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity.
!---
Simplicity is hard to build, easy to use.
!---
The unavoidable price of reliability is simplicity.
!---
Trying to outsmart a compiler defeats the purpose of using one.
!---
You’re bound to be unhappy if you optimize everything.
!---
A distributed system is one where failure you didn’t know about breaks you.
!---
The proper use of comments is to compensate for bad code.
!---
The best is the enemy of the good.
!---
Simplicity is the art of maximizing work not done.
!---
Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence.
!---
So much complexity comes from making one thing do two things.
!---
There’s nothing in computing that can’t be broken by indirection.
!---
A complex system that works evolved from a simple system that worked.
!---
Premature optimization is troublesome; premature abstraction is deadly.
!---
Languages that try to disallow idiocy become idiotic.
